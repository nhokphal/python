# import from local function on pc

from function import square # now its import square function from function local   


for i in range(10):
    print(f"the square of {i} is {square(i)}") # loop 10 times, each time we loop we print something else in the square function above





# second deference way approach 

import function 

for i in range(10): 
    print(f"the square of {i} is {function.square(i)} value") # calculate itself values
